## AIM:

To install an operating system using virtual box.


## PROCEDURE:

## STEP 1:

Download the live image from the fedoraproject website. If you are a KDE
Fan, go here.

## STEP 2:

Burn the .ISO image to a CD, DVD or a USB stick. Make sure that you write
it at a slow speed so that nothing gets broken in the process.

## STEP 3:

Change the BIOS settings. If you are using a live USB, you might need to go
into your BIOS and change the boot priority in order to boot from your USB.
You can access your computer's BIOS by pressing ‘F2' or ‘Delete' on most
computers when the computer is booting up. If you are using a CD or DVD,
ignore this step as generally CDs are first in boot priority.

## STEP 4:

Be sure to select "Live Drive" when the option screen first appears. If you
select to install it, it can potentially delete everything from your system.

## STEP 5:

Explore the system. The most notable thing about you should toy with is the
window manager which allows you to see pretty cool effects. You should also
explore around the applications already installed in the OS and see what
else is available with their package manager.

## Steps:6

Install the live image to your hard drive .If you have made the decision to
install Linux on your system, click on the "Install to Hard drive" icon on the
workspace

## Steps:7

Click on next when the installer starts and then select your keyboard layout.

## Steps:8

Choose the host name. It can be left as is or you can enter in the name you
desire. That is going to be the name for the computer. Then click on next.

## Steps:9

Select your time zone and click next.

## Steps:10

Enter your root password for the system. Make sure that the password is
something hard for others to guess; the security of your system depends on
it.

## Steps:11

Choose the mode of installation.Use entire drive. As the title says, Fedora
would clear off all the data on your hard drive and use the complete space
for its installation. But beware that you could lose all data on your drive.Use
free space. If you have allotted space on your hard drive, all that space is
used for Fedora installation.

## Steps:12

Choose one which suits you the most and click next. Confirm by clicking on

complete 

## Steps:14

Re-boot the computer when the installation is done. Go to System > Shut
Down and make sure to remove your live CD from the CD drive or your USB
drive from the USB port.

## Steps:15

## Steps:16

Click on forward again. At the Create User prompt, enter the user name you
desire, your full name, and your password.

## Steps:17

Set your date and time, then click on the ‘Network Time Protocol' tab. With
the network time protocol (NTP), your computer can fetch the current time
from a time server over the internet, so you do not have to adjust the time
every time DST goes into or out of effect. Select enable network time protocol
and click ‘forward'.
